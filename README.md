# ludumdare35

## About

This was our project for the Ludum Dare Game Jam event from 15th to 17th of April 2016.
Unfortunately, we didn't finish development in time.

Yet we are still working on it, so stay tuned! ;-)

## Installation

Just download the whole repository. There will be an executable lauch file in the main directory soon.
For now, there is a `teststarter.py` in `src/`, which can be run for testing purposes.

In order to run the game, please make shure you have both ***pygame*** and the Python Image Library ***PIL*** installed.
